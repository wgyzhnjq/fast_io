int main()
{
	print(fast_io::out,3,u8'\n');//WRONG. character is treated in fast_io library as integer by default. '\n' would be treated as its ANSI value
// The reason is that std::int8_t/std::uint8_t would be treated as integer in iostream which breaks a lot of generic programming code. I decide to NEVER support shit like this.

/*
Correct examples:
	println(fast_io::out,3);


	print(fast_io::out,3);
	put(fast_io::out,u8'\n');

	print(fast_io::out,3,u8"\n");

	fprint(fast_io::out,u8"%\n",3);	

	print(fast_io::out,3,fast_io::char_view('\n'));
