# fast_io

fast_io is a new header-only (module only in the future) experimental library to replace iostream and cstdio based on C++ 2a feature concepts.

## Compiler Support
- VS 16.3
- Clang 10.0
- GCC 10

## Platform Support
- Windows
- Linux
- MacOS
- Android

## Design Goal

  - Fast. As close to system call as possible.

Locale support optional  
Zero copy IO

  - Safe

No easily misused stuff like std::endl  
No internal iomanip states (since it creates security issues)  
Providing RAII for FILE\*&POSIX file id

- Easy to use

Unicode/UTF-8 support  
Compatible with C stdio and C++ iostream  
Binary serialization for trivially copyable types and C++ standard library containers  
All fast_io devices can be natively put in C++ containers. std::vector<fast_io::obuf> is valid  
Support C style io format (fprint). Basic/Lua/Python/etc format (print, scan).

- Customizability

Exception Safe & Exception neutral  
Native Handle Interface  
Extremely easy to support custom devices

- std::mutex mutex stream
- Compilation time open mode parse. Supports C style open mode and C++ style open mode.
- No traits_type and EOF
- Dynamic Type Support
- Pipe line support
- Cryptography (Under construction) to replace openssl
- debugging IO

## Post C++20 Plan
  1. Module support
  2. Coroutine support for async IO
  3. Improve and refactor code once [Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf) are added to the standard
  4. Network handle support with coroutine. (NOT ASIO library)
  5. Partial freestanding mode

## Possible Improvements
  1. Compression/Decompression
  2. Interfaces for cloud computing algorithms like MapReduce

I'm aiming for this to be in the C++ standard library in the future :)

## Getting Started 
Please see examples in the examples folder.

compile option:
    
`g++ -o example example.cc -O2 -std=c++2a -fconcepts`

## Documentation

./doxygen/html/index.html

Since C++ 20 has not been released. No standard supporting libraries for concepts, which means a lot of Concepts Definitions are ugly. It will be changed after C++ 20 is officially published.

#### Updated benchmark with trunk gcc

I did some optimizations to my fast_io library. Now there is NO reason to use charconv any more. It is insecure and the APIs are terrible. I hope isocpp would deprecate charconv in the future.
